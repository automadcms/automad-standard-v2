# Automad Theme Naming Conventions

This guide outlines the naming conventions to follow when developing an Automad theme. Consistent naming helps maintain readability and ensures seamless integration with Automadâ€™s UI and functionality.
Following these conventions ensures better organization, readability, and consistency across Automad themes.

## PHP Files

The names of templates in the root of this repository as well as block-templates in the `blocks/` and `snippets/` directories are exposed to the UI. The character `_` is used to identify whitespace. Therefore, unlike the naming convention for other PHP files, these files must be named using snake casing. This allows the Dashboard to convert filenames into a human-readable form, such as `masonry_large.php` being displayed as `Masonry Large`.

All other PHP files in an Automad theme that are not exposed to the UI should follow the standard camelCasing style.

## TypeScript Files

TypeScript files that define a single class must use PascalCase, while regular TypeScript files, such as modules and utilities, must use camelCase. For example, `MyElement.ts` represents a single class, whereas `myModule.ts` is a regular module.

## CSS and LESS Files

Stylesheets should only contain a single class, and file names must be CSS-compliant. All style files follow kebab-case, and the filename should match the included CSS class, prefixed with .std- in the class name. For example, `.my-class.less` defines `.std-my-class`, and `.hero-banner.less` defines `.std-hero-banner`.
